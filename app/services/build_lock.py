"""Redis-backed distributed lock around the Packer image build.

Why this exists: the build phase in `tasks.py` does a check-then-act pair
(`check_image_exists` → `packer.build`) on the shared OpenStack Glance store.
Two parallel workers triggering a build of the same `(project_id, image_name)`
both observe "not found" and both kick off a build, leaving a duplicate image
behind and burning ~10 minutes of compute. This lock serializes the build for
a given image name within a given OpenStack project so only one worker
actually builds; the other re-checks Glance after waiting and skips straight
to Terraform if the image now exists.

Backend: Redis (already present as Celery's result backend, no new dep).

Lock semantics:

* ``SET NX PX`` with a unique token holds the lock with a short TTL
  (default 5 min). A daemon thread inside the holder periodically
  refreshes the TTL via ``PEXPIRE`` so a long-running build can't
  outlive its lease.
* Release uses a Lua-CAS so a worker can never release a lock that
  another worker grabbed after the first one's TTL expired.
* If the holding worker process is killed before ``release()`` runs
  (SIGKILL, OOM, container restart), the heartbeat thread dies with
  it and the lock self-heals after ``ttl_ms`` — bounded staleness.
